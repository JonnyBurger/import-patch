# import-package

Just a simple proof of concept implementing the idea in this Twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/brunolemos/status/1125799321679609857](https://twitter.com/brunolemos/status/1125799321679609857)


You can install it using `npm install -g @jonny/import-patch`.
I have not implemented any error checking and there will be no support for this repo!

Just trying out an idea.
